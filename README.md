# CS465-Fullstack


In this full stack project, the frontend development involved a combination of traditional server-rendered Express HTML, JavaScript, and a more dynamic Angular-based Single Page Application (SPA). Express HTML is relatively straightforward, where the server renders the HTML and sends it to the client for display. This is simpler but requires page reloads for each interaction. JavaScript, especially when used on the client-side, allows for dynamic updates within the HTML page, enhancing user interactions without needing a full reload. In contrast, Angular SPA offers a more sophisticated experience by loading the entire application on the client side and dynamically updating the view as users interact with the app, making for a smoother, faster experience without frequent server requests. The project used MongoDB for its backend due to its flexible schema and ease of handling large datasets with diverse data structures, a key reason for using a NoSQL database in modern applications that require scalability and performance.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) differs from JavaScript in that it is a lightweight data format used for data exchange between a server and a client. While JavaScript is a programming language, JSON is a data representation format, and it serves as the intermediary for transferring structured data between the frontend and backend. In this project, JSON was crucial for sending data between the Angular SPA and the Express backend via API requests, ensuring smooth communication between the two layers. Refactoring code to improve functionality often involved creating reusable UI components, such as modular forms or buttons, which not only reduced redundancy but also made future updates easier. This enhanced both the efficiency of the codebase and the user experience by providing consistent and flexible components across the application. In terms of testing, ensuring secure endpoints required not only API testing with tools like Postman but also implementing layers of security, such as authentication tokens, to safeguard data. These practices have enhanced my understanding of secure, scalable, and efficient web development, all of which are skills crucial for advancing in my career field.
